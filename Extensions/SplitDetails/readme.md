# Instruction 
*tess19_tailored_v1.R*, a taliored version of the software tess19, outputs intermediate results of the random tessellation process. The output includes split hyper-planes of each cut, data points on the left or right side of the split plane, distances bewteen the points and the split plane. These intermediate results could help users to explore the random tessellation process (rtp) step by step, for example, users can use these intermediate results to visualize the rtp.
