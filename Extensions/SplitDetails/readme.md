# Instruction 
*tess19_tailored_v1.R*, a taliored version of software tess19, outputs more details of the random tessellation trees for posterior prediction of categorical data based on real valued predictors. Details include split hyper-planes of each cut, data points on the left or right side of the split plane, distances bewteen the points and the split plane. These details could help users to explore the split step by step, for example, users can use these details to to visualize the random tessellation process.
